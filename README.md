## ABSTRACT
Home automation system achieved great popularity in the last decades as it increases the comfort and quality of life. Smartphone applications are used to control and monitor the home appliances using different types of communication techniques. As mobile devices continue to grow in popularity and functionality, the demand for advanced ubiquitous mobile applications in our daily lives also increases. The project deals with the design and implementation of a flexible and low-cost Home Automation System for an android device to provide essential functionalities to our homes and associated control operations. In particular, with the help of an android device, one can manage the operations on home appliances, such as turning ON/OFF a bulb, television or microwave or any other home appliances.
